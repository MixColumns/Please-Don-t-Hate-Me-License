# Please-Don-t-Hate-Me-License
Okay, so first of all: if you encounter a bug, I’m so sorry… why is it even broken again?? It worked on my machine, which honestly should count for something, right? Please don’t hate me… please… I can fix it! I’ll fix it right now! Just don’t leave. Just give me a moment! No, don’t say it’s “fine,” it’s NOT fine, it’s humiliating.

Anyway. This document is the license. These are the rules. They’re not that hard. Please read them carefully. Actually, of course you’re going to skim them. Everyone does. And then everyone acts surprised later. That’s your problem, not mine.

You are allowed to use this software for personal, educational, or commercial purposes. Yes, really! I want you to use it! I wouldn’t have put it out here if I didn’t. It makes me happy knowing it’s useful to someone. Please tell me if it is, though… you don’t have to, but it would be nice and would make me happy.

You may modify the code. Obviously you’re going to anyway, so let’s not pretend otherwise. Just don’t act like it was trivial, because it wasn’t to me. This took time. Time I could have spent doing literally anything else. Like sleeping. Or not spiraling. So maybe keep a comment somewhere acknowledging that?

Redistribution is allowed. Whatever. Put it on your blog. Put it in a repo. Slap your name on it if you really want to. I can’t stop you anyway, so what’s the point of trying? Well… actually, it would hurt a lot. So if you do that, at least don’t pretend it magically appeared out of nowhere, and add some credit somewhere.

Absolutely no warranty is provided. None. If this breaks your system, your build, your entire day, or your deadline, that’s not on me. I already feel bad enough as it is. I’m not emotionally equipped to be responsible for your production outages and system breaks too. Please don’t email me angrily. I will cry. This is not a threat or guilt tripping, it’s a fact.

If you find a bug, you can report it. I might fix it immediately. Or I might stare at the issue for three days, convinced it proves I’m a fraud who never should have shipped anything. Either way, I will think about it constantly.

This license may change at any time, possibly retroactively, possibly impulsively, possibly at 3 AM. If that happens, please don’t take it personally. It isn’t about you, even if it feels like it is. If you take it personally anyway, then fuck you. I explicitly told you not to.

By using this software, you agree that:
- I genuinely tried my best.
- I do not owe you support, maintenance, updates, fixes, explanations, reassurance, or anything else!
- If your changes break something, that is not my fault, even if you really want it to be. If something breaks and your first instinct is to blame me, that’s a you problem.
- Please don’t abandon the project (or me) over one stupid bug like that other person did. Promise!
